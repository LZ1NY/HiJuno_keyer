Build a keyer to transmit QRSS message "HI" to Juno spacecraft ... 



"NASA's Juno spacecraft will fly past Earth on October 9, 2013 to receive a gravity assist from our planet, 
putting it on course for Jupiter. 

To celebrate this event, the Juno mission is inviting amateur radio operators around the world to say "HI" to Juno 
in a coordinated Morse Code message. 

Juno's radio & plasma wave experiment, called Waves, should be able to detect the message if enough people
participate. 

So please join in, and help spread the word to fellow amateur radio enthusiasts!"
